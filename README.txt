Wallet Reporters – Cloudflare Pages (Full Starter)

This is a static site intended for Cloudflare Pages.

Deploy (GitHub method recommended):
- Pages project -> Connect to GitHub -> select your repo
- Framework preset: None
- Build command: (blank)

If you're currently seeing a plain 'Starter site' page, you deployed a different minimal bundle earlier.
Replace the repo files with the contents of this zip, commit, then redeploy Pages.
